"""
Main Jarvis voice assistant orchestrator.

This module coordinates the voice assistant's core functionality, including:
- Wake word detection
- Speech-to-text transcription
- Command interpretation
- Text-to-speech response
- Music control via REST API integration

The assistant maintains a single shared microphone stream for efficiency
and provides voice control over a remote music bot service.
